# NeurIPS 2020: MineRL Competition Rainbow Baseline with PFRL

This repository is a **Rainbow baseline submission example with [PFRL](https://github.com/pfnet/pfrl)**,
originated from [the main MineRL Competition submission template and starter kit](https://github.com/minerllabs/competition_submission_template).

For detailed & latest documentation about the competition/template, see the original template repository.

This repository is a sample of the "Round 1" submission, i.e., the agents are trained locally.  

`test.py` is the entrypoint script for Round 1.  

The `train.py`, which is the entrypoint for Round 2, have not been checked if it could work on the MineRL Competition's submission system yet.
To train this baseline agent, see "How to Train Baseline Agent on your own" section below.

`train/` directory contains baseline agent's model weight files trained on `MineRLObtainDiamondDenseVectorObf-v0`.

# How to Submit

After [signing up the competition](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2020-minerl-competition), specify your account data in `aicrowd.json`.
See [the official doc](https://github.com/minerllabs/competition_submission_template#what-should-my-code-structure-be-like-)
for detailed information.

Then you can create a submission by making a tag push to your repository on https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/. Any tag push (where the tag name begins with "submission-") to your repository is considered as a submission.

If everything works out correctly, you should be able to see your score on the
[competition leaderboard](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2020-minerl-competition/leaderboards).

# About Baseline Algorithm

This baseline consists of two main steps:

1. [Apply K-means clustering](https://minerl.io/docs/tutorials/k-means.html) for the action space with the demonstration dataset.
2. Apply Rainbow algorithm on the discretized action space.

Each of steps utilizes existing libraries.  
K-means in the step 1 is from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html#sklearn.cluster.KMeans),
and Rainbow in the spte 2 is from [PFRL](https://github.com/pfnet/pfrl),
which is a Pytorch-based RL library.


# How to Train Baseline Agent on your own

`mod/` directory contains all you need to train agent locally:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn pandas tqdm joblib pfrl

# Don't forget to set this!
export MINERL_DATA_ROOT=<directory you want to store demonstration dataset>

python3 mod/dqn_family.py \
  --gpu 0 --env "MineRLObtainDiamondDenseVectorObf-v0"  \
  --outdir result \
